[synchronous]
  - a write transaction to the master will be blocked until it is written to the backup / standby nodes
    - wait for first n, or any
[asynchronous]
  - a write transaction is considered successful if it written to the master,
    then asynchronously the writes are applied to backup nodes

[pros]
  - horizontal scaling
  - region based queries - db per region

[cons]
  - eventual consistency
  - slow writes (synchronous)
  - complex to implement (multi master)
