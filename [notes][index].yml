[state when we do query]
  - use explain analyze (for postgres)
  - use explain (analyze, buffers) (for postgres)
  [parallel seq scan]
    - heap only search
    - o(n)
  [index scan]
    - index search and heap search
    - good
  [index only scan]
    - index search only
    - best

[tidy up structure]
  - vacuum (option) table
    - [options]
      - verbose
      - full
      - freeze
      - analyze
    - to rewrites the entire contents of the table into a new disk with no extra spaces (removing dead rows), allowing unused space to be returned to the OS
    - dead rows check is expensive

[create index concurrently]
  - postgres only
  - create index oncurrently id_idx on users(id)
  - higher cpu and memory usage
  - have a chance to fail

[force query to use specific index]
  - /*+ INDEX[index_name] */
    - SELECT * FROM table
    - WHERE id = n
    - /*+ INDEX[index_name] */;
