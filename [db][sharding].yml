[horizontal partition vs sharding]
  - hp splits in the same database
  - sharding splits across multiple database servers
  - hp table name changes (or schema)
  - sharding everything is the same but server changes

[pros]
  - scalability
    - data
    - memory
  - security (users can access certain shards)
  - optimal and smaller index size

[cons]
  - complex client
  - transaction across shards problem
  - rollbacks
  - schema changes are hard
  - joins
  - has to be something you know in the query
